an **AI-powered virtual assistant budtender chatbot**. This chatbot serves as a virtual assistant that helps users interact with and find information about cannabis strains, products, and more. The chatbot will be integrated into an interface where users can:

1. **Ask About Cannabis Strains**: Users can ask questions or input queries about cannabis strains, and the chatbot will respond with detailed strain information, such as:
   - Strain name
   - Type (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid, etc.)
   - Flavor profile (e.g., earthy, fruity, spicy)
   - Effects (e.g., relaxed, euphoric, happy)
   - THC and CBD content
   - Description of the strain

2. **Text and Voice Input**:  
   - **Text-based interaction**: Users will be able to type queries about cannabis strains into a text box. The chatbot will interpret the input and respond with information about strains that match the query. 
   - **Voice-based interaction**: You want to incorporate voice input as well. When a user presses a microphone button, they can speak their query, and the chatbot will recognize the voice input using the browser's **Speech Recognition** API, converting their speech into text. This will trigger a response from the chatbot as if they typed it out.

3. **Search Functionality**:  
   - **Strain Search**: When a user asks about a specific strain or a set of characteristics (e.g., "sativa strains with fruity flavors"), the chatbot will search through a database of cannabis strains and match their query with relevant strains.
   - The chatbot uses the information it has (e.g., strain name, effects, THC/CBD content, description) to provide users with a set of relevant results based on their query.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**:  
   - The chat interface will display messages from both the user and the bot in a clean, easy-to-read format.
   - Users can type and send messages directly into a chat box and see responses in a scrollable chat window.
   - Voice input will be triggered by a microphone button, and the chatbot will respond with appropriate text messages.

5. **Strain Data Storage**:  
   - You have a set of predefined cannabis strain data (strain name, type, effects, etc.) stored in an array. This data will be queried and used to respond to user questions.

6. **Enhanced User Experience**:  
   - **Dynamic Feedback**: The chatbot will continuously update the chat window, showing responses to the userâ€™s input in real-time.
   - **Interactive Design**: The design aims to be clean, intuitive, and easy to interact with, encouraging users to explore different cannabis strains and products.

### Key Functionalities You Want to Achieve:
- **Voice Recognition**: For hands-free interaction, allowing users to simply speak their queries and receive chatbot responses.
- **Real-Time Text Input**: Enabling the user to type questions, submit them by pressing Enter or clicking a button, and receive information instantly.
- **Search and Response Logic**: The chatbot will parse user queries, search the strain database, and return matching results.
- **Simple, Visually Appealing Interface**: The layout will be visually appealing and easy to navigate for users, with a consistent user experience for text and voice input.

In summary, you're creating a dynamic and interactive chatbot experience for users to explore cannabis strains using both text and voice input. The chatbot will provide detailed strain data, using an AI-powered search engine to match user queries with relevant strain information.
